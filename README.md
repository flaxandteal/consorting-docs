# Consortium-Building Documentation

This repository will link to resources on consortium building.

It follows @philtweir's [FOSDEM presentation](https://flaxandteal.github.io/fosdem-2019-consorting-with-industry/index.html) in the Community DevRoom.

## Diagrams

A couple of diagrams based off presentation content are here too...

* https://github.com/flaxandteal/consorting-docs/blob/master/images/contracting.png : Where our structure fits with other models (bear in mind, these are very rough, hand-wavey definitions, every coop, freelance group and startup works differently!)
